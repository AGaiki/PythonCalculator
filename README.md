# Installation
Download a release file from the "Releases." Extract it and run the EXE file.
Even though this program is compiled as an EXE, it still depends on Python, as well as Visual C++ Redistributable, so make sure you have that too!
# Building it!
So you want to build this Python project?
Make sure that you have at least Python 3.8 installed.
Download the source file (Python.py) and you can edit it using your favorite code editor!
